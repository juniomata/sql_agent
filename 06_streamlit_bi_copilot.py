    5. What is the average p1 lead score of leads in the database?
    6. What is the average p1 lead score of leads by member rating in the database?
    7. Calculate the the average p1 lead score of leads by member rating and return a scatter plot with a trendline.
    8. Which 10 customers have the highest p1 probability of purchase who have NOT purchased "Learning Labs Pro - Paid Course"?
    9. What are the top 5 product sales revenue by product name? Make a donut chart. Use suggested price for the sales revenue and a unit quantity of 1 for all transactions.
    10. What are the total sales by month-year? Use suggested price as a proxy for revenue for each transaction and a quantity of 1. Make a chart of sales over time.
    11. What are the total sales by charge_country for the top 10 countries? Make a horizontal bar chart with the charge_country ascending. Use suggested price as a proxy for revenue for each transaction and a quantity of 1.
